      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Having successfully completed my studies at the Illinois Institute of Technology, I hold a degree in Information and Technology Management. Throughout my academic journey, I engaged in numerous intensive courses and successfully completed complex projects, which greatly enhanced my skills and knowledge for my desired professional path. I am now eager to apply my expertise and capabilities in a full-time internship or employment opportunity. I possess a strong understanding of current technology practices and can contribute valuable insights to the organization or team I collaborate with. Furthermore, I have been trained in conducting thorough research and extracting actionable data, skills that are essential for any team's success.
